This is a work in progress.  Tests do not yet pass and the YAML test definitions are not present yet.

Currently we run tests in github CI using manual script definitions.  The framework here runs CHIP tests like any other
matter.js test.  Matter.js code runs locally in-process and chip-tool runs within Docker.
