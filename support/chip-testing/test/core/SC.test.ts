// Note - SC/4.3 fails intermittently (22 of 156 runs) on step 8, sometimes because of a name mismatch, sometimes
// because no name is found and the test doesn't check for None
//
// SC/4.1 seems to have a similar issue
//
// I believe this is because of other Matter devices on my local network.  Fixing will require coming up with an
// isolated networking solution...  Easiest might be to just create an Avahi MDNS implementation and run Avahi with no
// networking
