# Air quality sensor example

This example shows how to build a simple Air quality Sensor device with temperature, humidity, PMx and TVOC measurements.
It just defines initial static values, so it won't change over time.

## Usage

For general documentation about the CLI parameters or environment variables that can be used for matter.js please refer to the [Examples README](../../../examples/README.md#cli-usage).

Execute the following command in the examples root directory

```bash
npm run matter-air-quality-sensor
```
