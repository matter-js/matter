# Smoke CO Alarm Example

This example shows how to build a simple Smoke&CO Alarm Sensor Matter device.  It just defines initial static values,
so it won't change over time.

## Usage

For general documentation about the CLI parameters or environment variables that can be used for matter.js please refer to the [Examples README](../../../examples/README.md#cli-usage).

Execute the following command in the examples root directory

```bash
npm run matter-smoke-co-alarm
```
