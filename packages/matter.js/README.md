# matter.js

Implementation of Matter protocol in typescript with no native dependencies (and very limited dependencies).

This is the JavaScript-only Core of the Matter protocol. It is used by other projects to implement Matter Nodes and Clients and add the relevant specific implementations for Network and other elements.

> This package supports all Node.js LTS versions starting with 18.x

The following features are abstracted away to allow to be implemented environment specific:

-   Network (UDP/MDNS)
-   Crypto
-   Storage
-   Date/Timer
-   Logger (Default uses "console")
-   Environment (Process and Configuration handling)

## Exported functionality

This library exports the Matter protocol functionality as well as some helper functions as named exports:

### Included Cluster default implementations

Each cluster that has commands also needs to have them implemented based on the chosen feature set.

Matter.js provides a specification-compliant implementation of all Matter 1.3 clusters. For many clusters our implementations perform high-level business logic. For other clusters you provide the needed business logic by extending the matter.js implementation. In all cases matter.js takes care of details like the Matter protocol, input and output validation and persistence. The developer can then decide if own functionality needs to be implemented and can overwrite and extend these implementations or just use them.

For examples for nearly all clusters check the [All Clusters Test App](../chip-testing/src/AllClustersTestApp.ts).

Matter.js allows the following clusters to be used directly with a default implementation for all relevant commands - or the clusters do not need any commands and so the standard feature set of Matter.js for attributes is sufficient.
All clusters contained in this list are also verified using the CI YAML project-chip certification tests.

### Typescript note

To have Typescript and your IDE know all the relevant exported functionality you need to use the following in your tsconfig.json:

```json5
{
    compilerOptions: {
        moduleResolution: "node16", // Required to support package.json exports
        module: "node16", // Required to make sure all imports are js
    },
}
```

Additionally, we recommend using `"strictNullChecks": true` or better for code quality `"strict": true` to make sure that all types are correctly determined.

## matter.js usage

matter.js is used at the core of those two projects:

-   [matternode](https://github.com/project-chip/matternode): a light-weight node.js implementation of a Matter Node
-   [matter-node.js](../matter-node.js/README.md): a Matter client / server running on node.js compatible with HA (Android / iOs support in progress)

## Building

-   `npm run build`: Build all code and create CommonJS and ES6 variants in dist directory. This will built incrementally and only build the changed files.
-   `npm run build-clean`: Clean the dist directory and build all code from scratch

## Tests

-   `npm run test-node`: Run tests in node.js
-   `npm run test-web`: Run tests in the browser
-   `npm run test`: Run all tests

test-web will create a /coverage directory containing the test code coverage
