# Changelog for matter.js

This page shows a detailed overview of the changes between versions without the need to look into code, especially to see relevant changes while interfaces and features are still in flux.

The main work (all changes without a GitHub username in brackets in the below list) is done by the core team of this project completely in their free time (see their individual profiles for sponsoring options): @Apollon77, @lauckhart, @turon and @mfucci
