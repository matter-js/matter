Completed implementations:
- [X] TLV codec (coder/decoder) and schema mapping and validation engine
- [X] 12 cluster definitions (including TLV structures for all messages)

## matter.js usage

matter.js is used at the core of those two projects:
* [matternode](https://github.com/project-chip/matternode): a light-weight node.js implementation of a Matter Node
* [node-matter](https://github.com/mfucci/node-matter): a Matter client / server running on node.js compatible with HA (Android / iOs support in progress)

## Tests

Run tests in node.js: npm run test

Run tests in the browser: npm run test-web

test-web will create a /coverage directory conatining the test code coverage
